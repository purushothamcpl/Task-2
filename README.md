1. Overview
This analysis explores the Mall Customers dataset through aggregated visualizations of Spending Score, Annual Income, Age, and Gender. The goal is to highlight demographic patterns and spending behavior, providing a foundation for customer segmentation and business insights.

2. Key Visualizations in Task
a. Sum of Spending Score & Annual Income by Gender
Female customers contribute significantly to both spending score and annual income totals.

Male customers show lower aggregate values, suggesting females may represent a more engaged customer base.

b. Sum of Spending Score by Age
Spending scores vary across age groups, with peaks in younger demographics (20s–30s).

Indicates younger customers are more active spenders compared to older groups.

c. Count of Age by Gender
The distribution shows 112 males (56%) and 88 females (44%) in the dataset.

Balanced representation allows for gender-based comparative analysis.

d. Sum of Age by Gender
Aggregate age values suggest males dominate older age ranges, while females are more concentrated in younger segments.

This aligns with spending behavior patterns observed earlier.

3. Storytelling Flow
Demographics First

Gender split: 56% male, 44% female.

Age distribution shows diverse representation across young and middle-aged groups.

Spending Behavior Next

Females contribute more to overall spending scores.

Younger customers (20–30 years) drive higher spending activity.

Income vs. Engagement

Despite balanced gender counts, females show stronger aggregate income and spending.

Suggests marketing strategies should prioritize female shoppers and younger demographics.
